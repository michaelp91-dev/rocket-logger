### Rocket Flight Center

This repository contains the source code for a web-based **Model Rocket Flight Log** application. It serves as a tool for hobbyists to manage their rocket and engine profiles, plan flights with performance estimations, log flight data, and analyze post-flight results from a flight computer.

***

### üöÄ Features

* **Rocket & Engine Management**: Create, edit, and delete profiles for your custom rockets and standard model rocket engines.
* **Pre-Flight Estimation**: Run simulations based on rocket and engine specifications to estimate key performance metrics like total altitude, max velocity, and stability.
* **Flight Logging**: Log your flights, track their outcomes (Success or Failure), and add personal notes.
* **Data Analysis**: Analyze raw CSV data from a flight computer to calculate and display actual flight performance metrics such as max altitude, max G-force, and top speed.
* **Interactive Charts**: Visualize flight data with altitude and acceleration charts generated from flight computer data.
* **Data Persistence**: All saved rocket, engine, and flight data is stored locally in your browser using `localStorage`, ensuring your data is always available.
* **Responsive UI & Dark Mode**: A modern, responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS, including a toggle for light and dark modes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML**: Provides the foundational structure of the application.
* **CSS**: Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first approach and a custom stylesheet for additional theming.
* **JavaScript**: Powers the entire application logic, from data handling and calculations to UI interactions.
* **Chart.js**: A powerful charting library used to render the flight data graphs.
* **MathJax**: Renders mathematical equations for detailed calculation explanations within the application.
